## HTML Demo

### Project Description

This project provides an HTML web page that allows users to visualize the output of a deployed computer vision DNN model. Users can improve on and gain insights from their deployed model by uploading query/test images and examining the model's results for correctness through the user interface. The web page includes some sample query/test images from the Microsoft image set, as well as example output for 3 types of models: Image Classification, Object Detection, and Image Similarity.


### Requirements

This repo has the following requirements:
- Azure account
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- Conda environment created in the computervision-recipes [Setup Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/blob/master/SETUP.md)

Some of the notebooks in the JupyterCode repository will also instruct you to run some of the existing [scenario notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/tree/master/scenarios).

### Usage

#### Setup
- Clone the repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:microsoft/ComputerVision.git
```

- Execute the notebooks in JupyterCode in your conda environment to deploy a model and upload necessary code for the web page to work

#### Using the web page

To use a deployed model in the Use My Model tab:

1. Enter the model's API URL in the text field
1. Upload or select images to use:
  1. Webcam
    1. Allow the browser to use your web cam
    1. Select Capture Image to take a picture
    1. Select Add Images to add the captured image
  1. Samples
    1. Select an image by clicking on it
  1. Choose Files
    1. Select images to upload from your machine's file explorer
1. Select Upload to send the images to the model's API
1. View results below!

To view examples in the See Example tab:

1. Click on an image you wish to view
2. See results from image classification, object detection, and image similarity models below!
